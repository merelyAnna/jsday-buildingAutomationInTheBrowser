# Building Automation in the Browser - An Experience Report
Slides and sources for the talk about building automation in the browser given at [jsday 2019](https://2019.jsday.it/)

Having a bunch of IoT-ready and remotely controllable devices only makes sense if the controls are intuitive and the control surface is easily accessible. In the beginning of 2018, we started implementing such a user interface for our office building using only JavaScript with frameworks like BabylonJS and React. This interface displays the real-time state of our numerous devices, offers control panels for managing them and also incorporates other services, like AWS and a calendar-API.<br>
We now want to show you how our microservice-application fits into the the IoT-landscape and the overall architecture of our office building automation infrastructure and want to talk about the pitfalls we encountered and the lessons we learned. There is no prior knowledge required about BabylonJS, building automation or even JavaScript - the talk focuses on our experiences, our lessons learned and our architecture on a higher level, and does not go into technical details.

####NOTE: The slides are still a work in progress and have not yet been published.
